# Advanced VLSI Project Repository

This repository contains advanced VLSI design projects focused on digital filtering and signal processing. It is organized into two main projects:
1. **Project 1: 102-Tap FIR Filter Implementation** ‚Äì Demonstrates various FIR architectures (traditional, pipelined, parallel processing) to meet stringent performance specifications.
2. **Final Project: Digital Equalizer with Pipelined 4th Order IIR Filter** ‚Äì Implements a digital equalizer comparing a pipelined IIR filter to a traditional design for real-time audio processing.
